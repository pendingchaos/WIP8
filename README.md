#WIP8

A work in progress using C++ and OpenGL.

The program requires SDL2, SOIL, glm, JsonCPP, libdl, the c standard library, the c++ standard library, and an OpenGL 3.3 implementation.

To compile go to the directory (in a terminal) containing all the files then run:

python scripts/compile.py

If you have Code::Blocks or an IDE that can open Code::Blocks projects, you can open WIP8.cbp and compile using that IDE.
