#WIP8

A work in progress using C++ and OpenGL.

The program has only been tested on Linux and should only run on Linux.
The program requires SDL2, SOIL, glm, JsonCPP, libdl, a c standard library implementation, a c++ standard library implementation, and an OpenGL 3.3 implementation.

Most of them can be install by running this command:

```
sudo yum install SDL2-devel SOIL-devel glm-devel jsoncpp-devel
```

The rest should already be installed.

To compile go to the directory (in a terminal) containing all the files then run:

```
python scripts/compile.py
```

If you have Code::Blocks or an IDE that can open Code::Blocks projects, you can open WIP8.cbp and compile using that IDE.
